Hello Reader,
This is ProtoCommerce Hybrid Framework, which is built with Data-Driven approach, coupled with the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. 
I have created 3 page object classes and 2 test cases - 1. End to end test case and 2. Filling the form using data driven testing by using openpyxl library.
I've implemented cross-browser testing using pytest fixtures and command-line options for browser selection. This allows testers to choose browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge dynamically. 
I leverage Python's built-in logging module, allowing me to log various levels of messages and save them to a designated file.
